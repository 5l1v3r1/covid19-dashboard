About This Analysis . This analysis was done by Joseph Richards . In this project1, we attempt to estimate the true mortality rate2 for COVID-19 while controlling for country-level covariates34 such as: . age of outbreak in the country | transparency of the country&#39;s government | access to healthcare | demographics such as age of population and rural vs. urban | . Estimating a mortality rate lower than the overall reported rate likely implies that there has been significant under-testing and under-reporting of cases globally. . Interpretation of Country-Level Parameters . days_since_first_case - positive (very statistically significant). As time since outbreak increases, expected mortality rate increases, as expected. | cpi - negative (statistically significant). As government transparency increases, expected mortality rate decreases. This may mean that less transparent governments under-report cases, hence inflating the mortality rate. | healthcare avg. out-of-pocket spending - no significant trend. | hospital beds per capita - no significant trend. | Human Capital Index - no significant trend (slightly negative = mortality rates decrease with increased mobilization of the country) | percent over 65 - positive (statistically significant). As population age increases, the mortality rate also increases, as expected. | percent rural - no significant trend. | . Full details about the model are available at: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality&#8617; . | As of March 10, the overall reported mortality rate is 3.5%. However, this figure does not account for systematic biases in case reporting and testing. The observed mortality of COVID-19 has varied widely from country to country (as of early March 2020). For instance, as of March 10, mortality rates have ranged from &lt; 0.1% in places like Germany (1100+ cases) to upwards of 5% in Italy (9000+ cases) and 3.9% in China (80k+ cases).&#8617; . | The point of our modelling work here is to try to understand and correct for the country-to-country differences that may cause the observed discrepancies in COVID-19 country-wide mortality rates. That way we can &quot;undo&quot; those biases and try to pin down an overall real mortality rate.&#8617; . | The affects of these parameters are subject to change as more data are collected.&#8617; . | Appendix: Model Diagnostics . The following trace plots help to assess the convergence of the MCMC sampler. .",
