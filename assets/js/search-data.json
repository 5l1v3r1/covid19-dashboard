This analysis was done by Thomas Wiecki. Interactive visualizations were created by Hamel Husain. . The model that we are building assumes exponential growth. This is definitely wrong because growth would just continue uninterrupted into the future. However, in the early phase of an epidemic it&#39;s a reasonable assumption.1 . We assume a negative binomial likelihood as we are dealing with count data. A Poisson could also be used but the negative binomial allows us to also model the variance separately to give more flexibility. . The model is also hierarchical, pooling information from individual countries. . .

About This Analysis . This analysis was done by Joseph Richards . In this project1, we attempt to estimate the true mortality rate2 for COVID-19 while controlling for country-level covariates34 such as: . age of outbreak in the country | transparency of the country&#39;s government | access to healthcare | demographics such as age of population and rural vs. urban | . Estimating a mortality rate lower than the overall reported rate likely implies that there has been significant under-testing and under-reporting of cases globally. . Interpretation of Country-Level Parameters . days_since_first_case - positive (very statistically significant). As time since outbreak increases, expected mortality rate increases, as expected. | cpi - negative (statistically significant). As government transparency increases, expected mortality rate decreases. This may mean that less transparent governments under-report cases, hence inflating the mortality rate. | healthcare avg. out-of-pocket spending - no significant trend. | hospital beds per capita - no significant trend. | Human Capital Index - no significant trend (slightly negative = mortality rates decrease with increased mobilization of the country) | percent over 65 - positive (statistically significant). As population age increases, the mortality rate also increases, as expected. | percent rural - no significant trend. | . Full details about the model are available at: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality&#8617; . | As of March 10, the overall reported mortality rate is 3.5%. However, this figure does not account for systematic biases in case reporting and testing. The observed mortality of COVID-19 has varied widely from country to country (as of early March 2020). For instance, as of March 10, mortality rates have ranged from &lt; 0.1% in places like Germany (1100+ cases) to upwards of 5% in Italy (9000+ cases) and 3.9% in China (80k+ cases).&#8617; . | The point of our modelling work here is to try to understand and correct for the country-to-country differences that may cause the observed discrepancies in COVID-19 country-wide mortality rates. That way we can &quot;undo&quot; those biases and try to pin down an overall real mortality rate.&#8617; . | The affects of these parameters are subject to change as more data are collected.&#8617; . | Appendix: Model Diagnostics . The following trace plots help to assess the convergence of the MCMC sampler. .",
