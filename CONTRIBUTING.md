We highly encourage contributions to this project and welcome PRs.

Familiarity with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) is helpful.  All you need to do is include the appropriate front matter in your notebook.  See [this guide](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#customizing-blog-posts-with-front-matter). 

**A good pull request to emulate is [this one](https://github.com/github/covid19-dashboard/pull/33)** - study the Jupyter notebook closely, especially the first cell that specifies the metadata, and how cells are hidden with `#hide` or `#hide_input`.
